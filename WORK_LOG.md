| September 2 |  1:10-1:45  | Class time! Worked with my peers on understanding the problem set, and visualized some possible solutions. Upon realizing that it followed a similar structure to our maze solver from CS2, in terms of a grid where you want to find the shortest path, we decided to look back at Maze solver, and anylze some of the ways we tried to solve it (thus looking into bredth first and depth first search) While talking with Hannah, we determined that the best strategy is a breath first search (because we are looking for shortest path not num paths) and when doing a bredth first search, you can use a queue to keep track of moves. I also determined that you can just track each individual square on the game board as nodes, and just have the children be the possible dice rolls 1-6 from that initial node. Overall, this classtime was extremely productive, and when i begin my homework, I will hopefully be able to start implementing this into code. We also discussed that the snake/ladders might just be triggered by some sort of if/else statement that just changes the output node value, but i'm not 100% sure yet. |

I did spend some time remembering how queues work... but once I did, i quickly created a quick program to find the path of shortest distance treating this problem like maze solver (where instead of the possible children/paths being different directions, they were just a die roll of 1/2/3.. 6). However, I left adding the snakes and ladders in till later, and while I was able to get somewhat working code, I had way too many if-statements, that I felt like I could make more code fluent. |

However, this process somehow slightly messed up my solution, so that I pass the three tests, except for testLarger(). As I am getting 2, instead of the expected value of 3, I feel like this is either an indexing/ counting/ or edge case solution error. As I am running out of work time, I will leave fixing this error till after next class.  |
